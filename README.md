# Leet_Code_Blind75_SUM_OF_TWO
C++ code to see if the target number can be achieved by addition of two numbers from a given list of numbers. The following assumptions have been made:
Only 1 solution exists for a given target
No same number can be used twice.
Return the indices of the two numbers in any order
example:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
